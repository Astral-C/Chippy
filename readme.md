A simple chip8 emulator in c++ using SDL2 that I made for fun and to learn about emulation. 

It doesn't work fully yet and glitches out with many games, though it can run some. Also, I know there is already a chip 8 emulator called chippy, I just have yet to think of a better name, once I do though I'll update the repo's name.
